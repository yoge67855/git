Git pack format
===============

== pack-*.pack files have the following format:

   - A header appears at the beginning and consists of the following:

     4-byte signature:
         The signature is: {'P', 'A', 'C', 'K'}

     4-byte version number (network byte order):
	 Git currently accepts version number 2 or 3 but
         generates version 2 only.

     4-byte number of objects contained in the pack (network byte order)

     Observation: we cannot have more than 4G versions ;-) and
     more than 4G objects in a pack.

   - The header is followed by number of object entries, each of
     which looks like this:

     (undeltified representation)
     n-byte type and length (3-bit type, (n-1)*7+4-bit length)
     compressed data

     (deltified representation)
     n-byte type and length (3-bit type, (n-1)*7+4-bit length)
     20-byte base object name if OBJ_REF_DELTA or a negative relative
	 offset from the delta object's position in the pack if this
	 is an OBJ_OFS_DELTA object
     compressed delta data

     Observation: length of each object is encoded in a variable
     length format and is not constrained to 32-bit or anything.

  - The trailer records 20-byte SHA-1 checksum of all of the above.

== Original (version 1) pack-*.idx files have the following format:

  - The header consists of 256 4-byte network byte order
    integers.  N-th entry of this table records the number of
    objects in the corresponding pack, the first byte of whose
    object name is less than or equal to N.  This is called the
    'first-level fan-out' table.

  - The header is followed by sorted 24-byte entries, one entry
    per object in the pack.  Each entry is:

    4-byte network byte order integer, recording where the
    object is stored in the packfile as the offset from the
    beginning.

    20-byte object name.

  - The file is concluded with a trailer:

    A copy of the 20-byte SHA-1 checksum at the end of
    corresponding packfile.

    20-byte SHA-1-checksum of all of the above.

Pack file entry: <+

     packed object header:
	1-byte size extension bit (MSB)
	       type (next 3 bit)
	       size0 (lower 4-bit)
        n-byte sizeN (as long as MSB is set, each 7-bit)
		size0..sizeN form 4+7+7+..+7 bit integer, size0
		is the least significant part, and sizeN is the
		most significant part.
     packed object data:
        If it is not DELTA, then deflated bytes (the size above
		is the size before compression).
	If it is REF_DELTA, then
	  20-byte base object name SHA-1 (the size above is the
		size of the delta data that follows).
          delta data, deflated.
	If it is OFS_DELTA, then
	  n-byte offset (see below) interpreted as a negative
		offset from the type-byte of the header of the
		ofs-delta entry (the size above is the size of
		the delta data that follows).
	  delta data, deflated.

     offset encoding:
	  n bytes with MSB set in all but the last one.
	  The offset is then the number constructed by
	  concatenating the lower 7 bit of each byte, and
	  for n >= 2 adding 2^7 + 2^14 + ... + 2^(7*(n-1))
	  to the result.



== Version 2 pack-*.idx files support packs larger than 4 GiB, and
   have some other reorganizations.  They have the format:

  - A 4-byte magic number '\377tOc' which is an unreasonable
    fanout[0] value.

  - A 4-byte version number (= 2)

  - A 256-entry fan-out table just like v1.

  - A table of sorted 20-byte SHA-1 object names.  These are
    packed together without offset values to reduce the cache
    footprint of the binary search for a specific object name.

  - A table of 4-byte CRC32 values of the packed object data.
    This is new in v2 so compressed data can be copied directly
    from pack to pack during repacking without undetected
    data corruption.

  - A table of 4-byte offset values (in network byte order).
    These are usually 31-bit pack file offsets, but large
    offsets are encoded as an index into the next table with
    the msbit set.

  - A table of 8-byte offset entries (empty for pack files less
    than 2 GiB).  Pack files are organized with heavily used
    objects toward the front, so most object references should
    not need to refer to this table.

  - The same trailer as a v1 pack file:

    A copy of the 20-byte SHA-1 checksum at the end of
    corresponding packfile.

    20-byte SHA-1-checksum of all of the above.

== midx-*.midx files have the following format:

The meta-index files refer to multiple pack-files and loose objects.

In order to allow extensions that add extra data to the MIDX, we organize
the body into "chunks" and provide a lookup table at the beginning of the
body. The header includes certain length values, such as the number of packs,
the number of base MIDX files, hash lengths and types.

All 4-byte numbers are in network order.

HEADER:

	4-byte signature:
	    The signature is: {'M', 'I', 'D', 'X'}

	4-byte version number:
	    We reserve version number 1 for the format accepted by core git,
	and instead use version 0x80000001 for gvfs/master.

	1-byte Object Id Version (1 = SHA-1)

	1-byte Object Id Length (H)

	1-byte number (I) of base multi-pack-index files:
	    This value is currently always zero.

	1-byte number (C) of "chunks"

	4-byte number (P) of pack files

CHUNK LOOKUP:

	(C + 1) * 12 bytes providing the chunk offsets:
	    First 4 bytes describe chunk id. Value 0 is a terminating label.
	    Other 8 bytes provide offset in current file for chunk to start.
	    (Chunks are provided in file-order, so you can infer the length
	    using the next chunk position if necessary.)

	The remaining data in the body is described one chunk at a time, and
	these chunks may be given in any order. Chunks are required unless
	otherwise specified.

CHUNK DATA:

	OID Fanout (ID: {'O', 'I', 'D', 'F'}) (256 * 4 bytes)
	    The ith entry, F[i], stores the number of OIDs with first
	    byte at most i. Thus F[255] stores the total
	    number of objects (N).

	OID Lookup (ID: {'O', 'I', 'D', 'L'}) (N * H bytes)
	    The OIDs for all objects in the MIDX are stored in lexicographic
	    order in this chunk.

	Object Offsets (ID: {'O', 'O', 'F', 'F'}) (N * 8 bytes)
	    Stores two 4-byte values for every object.
	    1: The pack-int-id for the pack storing this object.
	    2: The offset within the pack.
		If all offsets are less than 2^31, then the large offset chunk
		will not exist and offsets are stored as in IDX v1.
		If there is at least one offset value larger than 2^32-1, then
		the large offset chunk must exist. If the large offset chunk
		exists and the 31st bit is on, then removing that bit reveals
		the row in the large offsets containing the 8-byte offset of
		this object.

	[Optional] Object Large Offsets (ID: {'L', 'O', 'F', 'F'})
	    8-byte offsets into large packfiles.

	Packfile Name Lookup (ID: {'P', 'L', 'O', 'O'}) (P * 4 bytes)
	    P * 4 bytes storing the offset in the packfile name chunk for
	    the null-terminated string containing the filename for the
	    ith packfile.

	Packfile Names (ID: {'P', 'N', 'A', 'M'})
	    Stores the packfile names as concatenated, null-terminated strings.
	    Packfiles must be listed in lexicographic order for fast lookups by
	    name. This is the only chunk not guaranteed to be a multiple of four
	    bytes in length, so should be the last chunk for alignment reasons.

TRAILER:

	H-byte HASH-checksum of all of the above.
